# Crimes-GEO-Application
GEO Application for crime mapping and spatial queries.

Dozens of crimes are taking place these days and  mapping a crime is probably the best approach to visualize and analyze crime data.
It is a key component which allows police officers and criminalysts identify patterns in crimes:
- Hot Spots
- Spatial Behaviour 

Having a crime mapping application allows to take right actions and prevent future crimes.

# Application Tools 
The application is written on R language and uses the following main libraries:
-	Leaflet 
-	Shiny
-	DBI and RPostgreSQL

# Dataset Description
The first dataset contains crime data and can be easily downloaded from the website of New York City:
* NYC Open Data: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

The second dataset contains boroughs of New York:
* ArcGIS Hub: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCP::new-york-city-borough-boundary-clipped-to-shoreline

# Database description
The application uses PostgreSQL and PostGIS extension for spatial queries. Before inserting the data into the database, all tables and PostGIS extension have to be created.

# Implemented Spatial Queries 
* Simple Text Query (Show me Crimes in Brooklyn)
* New Crime Inserting (Add a new crime with its features)
* New Area Inserting (Can add new polygon/area of a crime)
* k-NN or Nearest Neighbour (Find closest neighbours to a certain crime)
* Searching in a Radius (Can find crimes in a certain radius)
* Searching in a Certain Area/Polygon (Can find crimes in certain areas)
* Categorical Query (Cann find a crime with specific properties,like age,place or gender...)
* Cluster Linkages (Queries which is based on formulas from Clustering in Machine Learning Field):
  * UPGMA Linkage
  * Centroid Linkage
  * Complete Linkage
  * Single Linkage

# Examples 
* Searching in a Radius:

* Searching in a Certain Area/Polygon:
All we need to do is just draw the area and crimes will be found

* k-NN or Nearest Neighbour:
Let's find closest crimes to a specified one

* Cluster Linkages (Complete Linkage): The distance between two farthest points in clusters

# Finally  
The developed application demonstrates complexity of spatial queries as well as provides visualization of crimes in New York city. It gives opportunities to see crimes hot spots, apply different sorting algorithms, insert new data and make complex spatial queries. The main focus of the application is a demonstration of different variety of spatial queries. Hence, in order to be a complete crime mapping application the functionality must be extended.
